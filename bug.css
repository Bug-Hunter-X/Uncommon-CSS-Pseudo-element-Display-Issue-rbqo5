The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue where the `::before` pseudo-element is not displaying as expected:

```css
div {
  position: relative;
}

div::before {
  content: "This text should appear";
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
}
```

The problem is that the text does not appear because the `position: absolute;` property requires a defined width and height for the parent element (div). Without specified dimensions, the pseudo-element has no space to render within the parent container.
