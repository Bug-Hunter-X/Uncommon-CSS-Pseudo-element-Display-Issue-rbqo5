The solution involves adding width and height (or other dimension-setting properties such as min-width, max-width, etc.) to the parent element.  This gives the absolutely positioned pseudo-element a space to render within:

```css
div {
  position: relative;
  width: 200px; /* Added width */
  height: 100px; /* Added height */
}

div::before {
  content: "This text should appear";
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
}
```

Alternatively, using relative positioning will also display it correctly without requiring the parent dimensions.

```css
div::before {
  content: "This text should appear";
  position: relative; /* Changed to relative */
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
}
```
