# Uncommon CSS Pseudo-element Display Issue

This repository demonstrates an unusual CSS issue where a `::before` pseudo-element fails to display correctly due to a missing dimension on its parent container.  The issue highlights the importance of understanding the interaction between `position: absolute` and the dimensions of its parent element.

The `bug.css` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.css` provides the corrected version.
